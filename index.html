<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Harry Potter series is one of the best of all time and if you have not read it I highly suggest it.<p>

<h2>Harry Potter</h2>

 <p> Harry Potter found out he was a wizard on his eleventh birthday. He enrolled at Hogwarts school where he met his best friends Ron and Hermione. Soon enough he had to face Voldemort, one of the greatest sorcerers in the world who uses his powers for evil. In the end Good always wins but on his journey Harry lost some loved ones to the killing curse.</p>
<h2>Ginny Weasly</h2>

<p>Ginerva Molly Weasly a.k.a. Ginny is not only Ron's little sister but also Harry Potter's biggest love interest. J.K. Rowling even stated that Harry and Ginny are soulmates. But Ginny is a really strong character apart from Harry. Throughout the story people underestimate her talent, bravery, and strength. Personally she is my favorite character because she is relatable.<p>
<h3>The Chamber of Secrets</h3>

<p>This is the book where she is really introduced. In the beginning she is nervous around Harry but she still feels protective around him. She is sorted into Gryffindor like the rest of her family. Ginny is a timid first year who came into the possesion of a bewitched diary. The diary of Tom Riddle is slighly given to Ginny by Lucius Malfoy who was one of lord Voldemort's most loyal followers. Tom had opened the chamber fifty years ago and murdered a muggle born witch. Through the diary he had Ginny open the chamber and attack muggle borns. In the end he takes her in to the chamber to die so he can be reborn and Harry saves her life with the help of Faux the Pheonix. Harry is shocked to hear that Ginny opened the chamber but understands it wasn't her fault. Ginny, however, is ashamed that Harry knew it was her. She also felt like the whole school hated her.</p>
