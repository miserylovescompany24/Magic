<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Harry Potter series is one of the best of all time and if you have not read it I highly suggest it.<p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Here is a list of the cast</a>
</div>
<h2>Harry Potter</h2>

 <p> Harry Potter found out he was a wizard on his eleventh birthday. He enrolled at Hogwarts school where he met his best friends Ron and Hermione. Soon enough he had to face Voldemort, one of the greatest sorcerers in the world who uses his powers for evil. In the end Good always wins but on his journey Harry lost some loved ones to the killing curse.</p>
<h2>Ginny Weasly</h2>

<p>Ginerva Molly Weasly a.k.a. Ginny is not only Ron's little sister but also Harry Potter's biggest love interest. J.K. Rowling even stated that Harry and Ginny are soulmates. But Ginny is a really strong character apart from Harry. Throughout the story people underestimate her talent, bravery, and strength. Personally she is my favorite character because she is relatable.<p>
<h3>The Chamber of Secrets</h3>

<p>This is the book where she is really introduced. Ginny is a timid first year who came into the possesion of a bewitched diary.</p>
