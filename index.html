<h1>The Best Series You Will Ever Read</h1>
<div>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Here is a list of the cast</a>
</div>
 <div class="char">
<h2>Harry Potter</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/HarryPotter5poster.jpg">
 <p> Harry Potter found out he was a wizard on his eleventh birthday. He enrolled at Hogwarts school where he met his best friends Ron and Hermione. Soon enough he had to face Voldemort, one of the greatest sorcerers in the world who uses his powers for evil. In the end Good always wins but on his journey Harry lost some loved ones to the killing curse.</p>

 <h2>Ginny Weasly</h2>
<img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/4/43/Ginny_Weasley_hbp_promostills_09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090317022247">
<p>Ginerva Molly Weasly a.k.a. Ginny is not only Ron's little sister but also Harry Potter's biggest love interest. J.K. Rowling even stated that Harry and Ginny are soulmates. But Ginny is a really strong character apart from Harry. Throughout the story people underestimate her talent, bravery, and strength. Personally she is my favorite character because she is relatable.<p>

  <h3>The Chamber of Secrets</h3>
<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/a/a7/Ginny_x.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/155?cb=20140624030039">
<p>This is the book where she is really introduced. In the beginning she is nervous around Harry but she still feels protective around him. She is sorted into Gryffindor like the rest of her family. Ginny is a timid first year who came into the possesion of a bewitched diary. The diary of Tom Riddle is slighly given to Ginny by Lucius Malfoy who was one of lord Voldemort's most loyal followers. Tom had opened the chamber fifty years ago and murdered a muggle born witch. Through the diary he had Ginny open the chamber and attack muggle borns. In the end he takes her in to the chamber to die so he can be reborn and Harry saves her life with the help of Faux the Pheonix. Harry is shocked to hear that Ginny opened the chamber but understands it wasn't her fault. Ginny, however, is ashamed that Harry knew it was her. She also felt like the whole school hated her. </p>

 <h3>The Order of the Pheonix</h3>
 <p> In the fifth one Ginny becomes a more prominant character. She not only signs up for Harry's student defense club but she comes up with the official name of Dumbledore's Army. In this one she surprises everyone with her talent. She is sort of underlined as the strongest supporting character. In the book she helps Harry through a tough time because she can relate to what he is going through.
